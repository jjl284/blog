TODAY:
* visited World of Coca Cola
  * tasting area was awesome! try Coke products and flavors from around the world
  * Beverly was ... interesting
* Center for Civic and Human Rights exhibits were sobering
  * Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s
  * current events in Syria, Burma, Honduras
* took a stroll through downtown Atlanta
  * everything closes at 5 pm on Sunday
* walked around Georgia Tech campus; lots of students walking in a line, freshmen orientation?
* ended up at South City Kitchen again by accident for dinner
  * everything had butter except the pulled pork
* bought some peaches

LEARNINGS:
* After consuming lactose, I get very tired (or maybe it's the 5 hour sleep cycle)
