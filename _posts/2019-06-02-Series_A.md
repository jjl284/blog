Poem celebrating closing Series A

*on shoulders of giants that carry us forward<br>
we follow the great pioneers<br>
but every so often, we forge our own path to<br>
define and explore a frontier*

*our path may be windy or covered with potholes,<br>
the mountain before us seems higher<br>
that summit so worthy of challenge and honor<br>
attained by the team that won't tire*

*to face unknown trials takes more than just effort<br>
as talented forces accrue<br>
yet what drives success is the way that we act<br>
on the things we despise, yet must do*

*and so we can choose and decide who we want<br>
the faithful? the faultless? the fun?<br>
with passionate prowess, the master and steward<br>
needs will to do what must be done*
