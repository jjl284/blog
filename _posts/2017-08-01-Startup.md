title: Away we go!
---

- gum graft surgery in the morning
- told not to go to work and I should pick up meds and sleep instead
- 20 minute nap at Safeway to get a bottle of Vicodin, antibiotics, and steroids
- 2 cans of soup for lunch
- tried to nap for 2 hours; ended up coding for 1 hour, sleeping then coding again
- code red: email from beta user at 3 pm, app broke due to last night's db changes
  - impact: user's app crashes when loading customer responses and she's unable to continue a live conversation with a customer
  - 45 mins: parse data straight from db and send to her
  - 1.5 hours: db integrity check and db fixed
  - 2 hours: tested recovery with Android app and added an automated health check to ensure won't happen again
- verified that our DUNS number is now accepted by Apple and we move to next stage of acquiring an Apple developer account
- took an ex-intern to intern game night at Medallia
- played 'what do you meme?' and met a bunch of potential recruits
- dinner was excruciatingly slow; soft tofu and a macaroni soup but I only used left side of mouth
- made a blog
- finishing farewell poem
