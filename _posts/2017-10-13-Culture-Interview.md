# Context

The year is 2014.  We are ~100 employees.  We are expected to triple in size in the coming year.  How do we preserve our culture?

"The easiest way to solve a problem is to avoid having it in the first place" - i made that up but it sounds good amirite?

We had two initial defenses against the dreaded culture shift that inevitably happens as a company grows.  The first was our culture interview process.  The second was our cultural onboarding which deserves its own post.

It's purpose is to both provide clarity to a candidate on the "corporate values" at Medallia and for us to see if the candidate shares in those values.  This took us a lot of iterations to refine and nobody believes that our technique was perfected.

1. Every hire in every department must go through a culture interview by a member from a different department
2. A no from a culture interviewer is a hard no

The first requirement meant we needed a pool of culture interviewers from every department.  The second requirement meant these individuals had quite a lot of power and thus needed to represent the best of Medallia's culture.

The interview itself is a walk through a candidate's life story in his or her own words with occasional prompts and questions by the interviewer.  We walk through a person's pivotal decisions, typically made when facing challenges and conflict and try to understand their motivations, beliefs, and learnings.

# Values

So, what were our values?  In no particular order:

* growth mindset
* intrinsic motivation
* ownership
* smarts
* values others

For each value, I'll describe it's definition, why we believe it important to culture, and signs of its presence or absence:

### Growth Mindset

Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.  It is the recognition that people (including oneself) can change.  For more info on growth mindset, please read [Carol Dweck's book](https://www.mindsetonline.com/).

People that show a fixed mindset are unable to recognize growth in others.  For example, an engineer who is frustrated with a manager will not acknowledge that the manager can learn from feedback and may never consider actually providing feedback at all.  Instead they slowly get more and more frustrated at circumstances until they leave unhappily.  The same can hold true for ones belief about co-workers, other teams, or even leadership.

Most candidates find it wasy to describe personal struggle and their ability to overcome it through effort by adapting or learning.  Detecting whether one recognizes growth in others can come across easily through examples of mentorship, or helping co-workers.  Examples of fixed mindset can come through in anecdotes of others.  Describing a manager who "will never change".  Note that believing that you alone can not change somebody's opinion is not the same as believing that person's opinion can never be changed, which leads us to the next value.

### Smarts

Instead of IQ or EQ, smarts here refers to creativity/resourcefulness and a drive to learn from mistakes.

We value people that apply creativity in problem solving and anticipate problems..

This ties closely to ownership for me but the difference is if you face conflict and only attempt one solution, then you've exhibited ownership but not resourcefulness.  If you attempt to solve a problem in different ways, you've now exhibited creativity!  People that try only once

Resourcefulness in applying different techniques whether it's asking fellow co-workers or reaching out to HR or

### Values Others

Valuing others is the ability to trust others.

Communication and trust is necessary for any organization and members that do not value others.

This one comes across easily for me when asking for examples of team failures or personal conflict.  When a team fails, do you blame the leader or individuals that didn't contribute enough?  Do you portray yourself as the victim of circumstances?  If you disagree with your manager's decision, do you simply walk away believing they are wrong and you are right?  Do you strive to better understand their perspective and priorities?  Do you attempt to compromise?  Is it worth the effort?

Disparaging remarks about groups of people are a massive red flag.  For example, "everybody on our team hit the  deadlines perfectly, but you know contractors never finish on time".

### Intrinsic Motivation

Competitiveness vs collaboration

### Ownership

Ownership is the ability to admit and take responsibility for failures.

People that do not admit mistakes are very dangerous.  I've seen engineering managers that still paint their last major project as a rosy success story despite the fact that their team stays up working on late night on-fire emergencies three times a week.  People that recognize such failures and do nothing about them is just as bad!

Obvious signs of lack of ownership are people that simply blame the environment or others for missed deadlines.  People that refuse to give feedback because "somebody else should have complained".

# Evaluation

This was not a "if you manage to score 3 out of 5 values, then you pass".  The assessment itself was up to the interviewer and candidates usually exhibited weaknesses in at least one or two areas..  At times, when truly unsure of what decision to make, we brought up the red flags and allowed the hiring manager to make a judgment call.

# Challenges

Challenges were plentiful when conducting this type of interview.

Messaging around "culture fit" or "assessment" tends to make people fear that they are judged according to a hard scale or rubric.  Positioning the interview as a dialogue was key to avoiding stress and tension.

The private nature of this conversation itself caused a lot of issues.  Some people are naturally closed about their past.  Some people are naturally less introspective about their past decisions and learnings.  Opportunities to shadow or record these discussions were rare since people are naturally less forthcoming when sharing to two people instead of one.  This made it very difficult to achieve a consistent candidate experience.

In addition, everybody faces different challenges in life.  If a candidate never had a "bad manager", then it becomes harder

Having a growth mindset about our candidates themselves means that we believe they too can learn these values.  Was it fair to say that a candidate who doesn't exhibit ownership can't learn to do so?  Context helped in setting expectations.  A fresh college graduate with no experience can be forgiven and expected to learn ways to express valuing others.  A senior manager with two decades of experience leading others should probably be able to convey that they care about people as they describe their career path.

# Patterns

It's not about the story itself, it's about how they describe the characters and motivations.  Are they always the victim or the hero?  Victim mindset is a huge red flag for me.

Imposter syndrome is a flag that if a manager needs to be able to support the individual to build confidence.

The key to understanding a person's values comes down to how they handle challenges and how they resolve conflict.

Many times, the values tend to overlap.  For example, a person who blames others for failures probably doesn't  value others or exhibit ownership.

Typically with a skills or technical interview, we assess both a person's experiences and their potential.  Potential is usually evaluated via hypothetical situations; but in a culture interview, what people "say" they would do often varies drastically from what they actually do.

The assessment itself is quite similar to a normal interview.  You are deciding whether this is the right job for the candidate, if they will thrive in this environment.  You are also deciding whether this is the right candidate for the job, whether others will thrive working with him or her.

Culture is not static either; it is defined by the individual of an organization and changes over time.  Homogeneity is not the goal either.

I've spent hours deliberating on judgments for candidates who are just on the border between exhibiting red flag behaviors, but believing in some of the values with the potential to grow.
