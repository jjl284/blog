Perspectives from a backend engineer learning how to write embedded software specifically on Nordic's nRF52832.

These are some general things I wish somebody would have told/reminded me ...

General:
* everything is single-threaded
  * the program will be basically:

setup_everything();
while(true) {
  do_work_if_needed();
  sleep();
}

* everything is interruptable
* memory!!
  * super constrained environment (16 kb of RAM to work with)
  * buffer overruns are very hard to debug!
    * do not confuse number of bytes with number of elements in a buffer!
* pay attention to signed vs unsigned types

There are four layers to the stack:
* ARM Cortex M4
  * this is the embedded processor
  * code at this layer is invoking specific ARM instructions to e.g. configure interrupts
* nRF52832
  * this is the microcontroller
  * code at this layer is manipulating registers and specific memory addresses defined by Nordic
* nRF SDK
  * this is a C library written by Nordic to handle writing to registers for you
  * code at this layer is calling library functions which hide some of the complexity of the Nordic stack
* SoftDevice
  * this is a C library written by Nordic which handles Bluetooth communication
  * code at this layer is also calling library functions but in a way that is "safe" in the Bluetooth-enabled stack

Some meta-tricks to make this more effective:
* download all of the manuals so you have access offline
  * The Nordic website goes down for maintenance suprisingly often which can be really inconvenient
* similarly, download all the datasheets for hardware that you'll attach to the board

Ok, first some basics:
* In the SDK, each functionality is offered by a specific "peripheral"

SPI vs TWI
PPI

power measurement

debugging
    reset
    NRF_LOG_INFO
	float issues
