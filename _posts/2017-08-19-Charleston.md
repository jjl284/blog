YESTERDAY:
* wandered around French Quarter of Charleston, SC
* lunch at Hannibal's Kitchen (salmson sausage rice)
* visited Fort Sumter
* light salad for dinner
* finished Gmail + GitHub integration, comments should now be working!
* added an RSS feed

TODAY:
* quick drive to Savannah
* historic district, lots of fountains and churches
* Bonaventure Cemetary
* Sandfly BBQ for lunch
  * Brunswick stew - spicy, tomato-based stew
  * pork belly sliders
* Wormsloe Historic Site

LEARNINGS:
* svg support for background-image in css doesn't work when rendering text
  * probably cleaner to just use normal text instead ...
* how RSS feeds work
* my legs react very differently than my hands to mosquito bites! (circular rash/bruise after 3 days vs raised bump which vanished in a day, respectively)
