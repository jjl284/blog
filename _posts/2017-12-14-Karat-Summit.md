*fears of the future and praise for the past<br>
scaling and growing too slow or too fast?<br>
what is the mission, the values, the goal?<br>
are we positioned at rear or the pole?<br>
if the field's empty, should we be concerned?<br>
take on new paths or extend what we've learned?*

*time to contract for there's magic to make<br>
bringing together the holders of stake<br>
into a place where ideas can be shared<br>
thoughts can run free and opinions be bared<br>
problems and pain points to ponder in groups<br>
stories that swirl in a savory soup*

*cooking and singing to ease unknown tension<br>
faces recalled in the next @ops mention<br>
slowly but surely, the roots start to form<br>
forest of friendships to weather a storm<br>
experts at caring, we strive for the best<br>
whether we're busy or tired or stressed*

*so much diversity yet we're in sync<br>
passion and empathy ever our link<br>
people that value the path we provide<br>
quality interviews taken worldwide<br>
sometimes what's simple takes more than it seems<br>
thank you to Karat for daring to dream*
