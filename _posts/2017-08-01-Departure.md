TODAY:
* gum graft surgery in the morning
* told not to go to work and I should pick up meds and sleep instead
* 20 minute nap at Safeway to get a bottle of Vicodin, antibiotics, and steroids
* 2 cans of soup for lunch
* tried to nap for 2 hours; ended up coding for 1 hour, sleeping then coding again
* code red: email from beta user at 3 pm, app broke due to last night's db changes
  * impact: user's app crashes when loading customer responses and she's unable to continue a live conversation with a customer
  * 45 mins: parse data straight from db and send to her
  * 1.5 hours: db integrity check and db fixed
  * 2 hours: tested recovery with Android app and added an automated health check to ensure won't happen again
* verified that our DUNS number is now accepted by Apple and we move to next stage of acquiring an iOS developer account
* took an ex-intern to intern game night at Medallia
* played 'what do you meme?' and met a bunch of potential recruits
* dinner was excruciatingly slow; soft tofu and a macaroni soup but I only used left side of mouth
* made a blog, learned jekyll + github (+ bit of scss copy/pasta)
* send farewell poem

TOMORROW:
* party planning stuffs
* merge last case
* take meds
* take stuffs home
* swing dancing
* sadness
* update resume

LEARNED:
* dropwizard health checks
* jekyll + github
* how much I'll miss everybody @ Medallia

My farewell poem:

*many suns and moons ago, a grove of trees took root<br>
and in their struggles growing larger, they had to recruit<br>
to stellar schools and foreign fields, the search for talent ran<br>
attract the best, describe the quest, a visionary plan*

the goal: to help these businesses to listen, act, and win<br>
on feedback from their customers, the concept underpins<br>
loyalties, relationships for brands consumers trust<br>
and when it comes to CEM, Medallia is a must*

to one without a clue at all of what this really means<br>
I joined because I saw a chance to train and build machines<br>
to automate, to analyze, such insights we could show<br>
but little did I realize how much that I would grow

for here amongst our copse of trees was quite a diverse group<br>
perspectives, views, and different tastes make one intriguing troupe<br>
from Nordic devs to Argentines, to Chetan and the Turks<br>
from gaming geeks to frisbee fiends, we each had unique quirks

beneath these towering canopies, a tiny seed can grow<br>
to learn from mentors, strive and struggle, challenge status quo<br>
initiative and ownership were ever at our core<br>
to take on tasks without an ask, and think it not a chore

as conflicts clashed, mishaps were made, and every loss grew deep<br>
our time and effort dwindled down and doubts began to seep<br>
but scars we gain will fade in time, each storm will pass in turn<br>
each failure has at least one lesson from which we can learn

recall our wins and progress made, how far we've come along<br>
look back with pride at history, dwell not on what went wrong<br>
for every day, we have a choice; to linger or to move<br>
and of those choices, only one impels us to improve

and when it's time to float away, depart on foreign wind<br>
the spice and salt from yesterday are what leave us seasoned<br>
the best of wishes for you all, the future waits for none<br>
I shall be rooting hard for you; from ground to sky to sun
