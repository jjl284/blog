Christine took me along to the San Jose Rock n Roll on Sunday!  She texted me about bringing popcorn chicken to a potluck as I was finishing this poem ...

*blisters and bruises and soreness and sweat<br>
minor misfortunes that we'll soon forget<br>
what we remember is running a race<br>
lengthening limits and pushing our pace*

*heartened by rock bands, and cheerleader squads<br>
medics, and marching bands came to applaud<br>
giving encouragement, water and lagers<br>
freely to sprinters and trotters and joggers*

*so many passionate people that day<br>
ran through the neighborhoods of San Jose<br>
many retired and some in their prime<br>
some came for records, and others? first time!*

*where shall we head next? perhaps off the trail?<br>
over to distant lands? shall we set sail?<br>
loving your rhythm, the estride and the gait<br>
rhymes make me hungry for fried chicken plate*
