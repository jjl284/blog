My farewell poem to Medallia:

*many suns and moons ago, a grove of trees took root<br>
and in their struggles growing larger, they had to recruit<br>
to stellar schools and foreign fields, the search for talent ran<br>
attract the best, describe the quest, a visionary plan*

*the goal: to help these businesses to listen, act, and win<br>
on feedback from their customers, the concept underpins<br>
loyalties, relationships for brands consumers trust<br>
and when it comes to CEM, Medallia is a must*

*to one without a clue at all of what this really means<br>
I joined because I saw a chance to train and build machines<br>
to automate, to analyze, such insights we could show<br>
but little did I realize how much that I would grow*

*for here amongst our copse of trees was quite a diverse group<br>
perspectives, views, and different tastes make one intriguing troupe<br>
from Nordic devs to Argentines, to Chetan and the Turks<br>
from gaming geeks to frisbee fiends, we each had unique quirks*

*beneath these towering canopies, a tiny seed can grow<br>
to learn from mentors, strive and struggle, challenge status quo<br>
initiative and ownership were ever at our core<br>
to take on tasks without an ask, and think it not a chore*

*as conflicts clashed, mishaps were made, and every loss grew deep<br>
our time and effort dwindled down and doubts began to seep<br>
but scars we gain will fade in time, each storm will pass in turn<br>
each failure has at least one lesson from which we can learn*

*recall our wins and progress made, how far we've come along<br>
look back with pride at history, dwell not on what went wrong<br>
for every day, we have a choice; to linger or to move<br>
and of those choices, only one impels us to improve*

*and when it's time to float away, depart on foreign wind<br>
the spice and salt from yesterday are what leave us seasoned<br>
the best of wishes for you all, the future waits for none<br>
I shall be rooting hard for you; from ground to sky to sun*
