I recently attempted a 40 mile backpacking trip with two friends which included 11 miles on the first day with a 2k ft ascent.  During this stretch, I realized the effectiveness of hiking poles for both ascending and descending.  One of our friend's knee was injured during this climb and I would hope that proper poling may have prevented the sprain.

There's two things to remember when it comes to adjustments:

1. length
2. grip

### Length

Most hiking poles are adjustable, but which length is proper?  The arm is naturally at rest when the elbow is at 90 degrees, the forearm is parallel to the ground, and the upper arm is hanging loosely.  This is the same arm posture we use when on a computer!  It doesn't have to be exactly 90 degrees, but it shouldn't be less.  Here's my most comfortable posture:

Hiking poles can (partially) collapse while hiking.  Don't forget to adjust them whenever you notice discomfort!

### Grip

How do we hold hiking poles?  The straps are actually quite crucial!!!  If you hold a hiking pole without the strap, you'll rely on the clench of your fingers to hold onto the pole.  This means your entire weight is on your fingers.  Hiking pole straps are actually meant to wrap around the wrist so that your weight falls onto the meaty part of your thumb:

This distributes the weight across the side of your thumb and your wrist which are much more sturdy than your fingers.  Make sure to tighten the strap securely; otherwise, it may rub and cause blisters!

Happy hiking!!!
