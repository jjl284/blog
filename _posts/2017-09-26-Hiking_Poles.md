I recently attempted a 40 mile backpacking trip with two friends which included 11 miles on the first day with a 2k ft ascent.  One of our friend's knee was injured during this climb and I believe that proper usage of hiking poles may have prevented the sprain.

There's two things to remember when it comes to adjustments:

1. length
2. grip

### Length

Most hiking poles are adjustable, but which length is proper?  The arm is naturally at rest when the elbow is at 90 degrees, the forearm is parallel to the ground, and the upper arm is hanging loosely.  This is the same arm posture we should use when on a computer!  It doesn't have to be exactly 90 degrees, but it shouldn't be less.  Here's my most comfortable posture:

It should be almost effortless to use the poles walking on flat ground since you won't have to raise them too high or too low as they swing.

Don't forget to adjust the poles whenever you notice discomfort!  Sometimes, I like to extend them a bit longer when going downhill or keep them shorter when going up.

### Grip

How do we hold hiking poles?  The straps aren't meant to be loose!!!  If you hold a hiking pole without the strap, you'll rely on the clench of your fist to hold onto the pole.  This means that you're relying on the friction between your fingers and the pole to bear your weight.  Hiking pole straps are actually meant to wrap around the wrist so that your weight falls onto the meaty part of your thumb like this:

This distributes the weight to:
* the inner edge of your hand (base of your thumb)
* the outer edge of your hand
* wrists

These parts of your hand should be able to bear a lot more weight comfortably.

Make sure to tighten the strap.  If it's loose, it may rub and cause blisters!

Happy hiking!!!
