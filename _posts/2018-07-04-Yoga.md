Poem for yoga!

*goals give us purpose yet reason to fret<br>
how to face failure without the regret?<br>
mindful attention can help us assert<br>
focus, be grounded, or fly or invert*

*root to the earth and let tension release<br>
bones will support as they stack over knees<br>
strengthened and stretched as we start to restore<br>
burdens fall free as they flow to the floor*

*gently we take off and fly, then alight<br>
trusting our bases to keep us at height<br>
up in the air we are free to explore<br>
balanced and steady from tips to the core*

*as we revolve, on an axis, a plane<br>
that which seems constant won't always remain<br>
downturns and upturns, they cycle anew<br>
head over heels shows a new point of view*

*moments of challenge, they bring out our best<br>
efforts requiring control and finesse<br>
patience and practice empower this art<br>
all is in reach with intent and a start*
