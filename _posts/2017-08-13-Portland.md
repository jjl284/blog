YESTERDAY:
* rainy morning, hiked to a scenic viewpoint, but only saw fog
* hiked Precipice Trail (lots of rocks), great view on the way down when mist lifted
* crab roll and a salad for lunch
* wendy's for dinner

TODAY:
* land's end
* lighthouse!
* banana and plum for lunch
* found a silent auction raising money for a fire department!
* had a fantastic lobster diavolo at Street & Co. (paired with a divine grapefruit juice)
* lemon + passion fruit sorbet afterwards

LEARNED:
* can sort of listen to country music now
* wendy's isn't as great as it was in my youth :'(
* Precipice Trail is a bit risky in precipitation
* starting to forget what we did each day
