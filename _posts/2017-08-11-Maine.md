TODAY:
* beautiful morning skies
* had a super tasty lobster roll for lunch
  * took dairy pills, but stomachache still lasted into the afternoon
  * probably worth it, but might not repeat
* found a L.L. Bean's flagship store in Freeport, Maine
* hike at Otter Point in Acadia Nat'l Park
* KFC!
* had some trouble setting up a logback-test.xml to write to stdout when running unit tests within Eclipse
  * my solution was to add -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback-test.xml as a jvm arg (so it gets automatically set for all unit tests)

LEARNED:
* I'm still lactose intolerant q.q
* IFTTT doesn't support commits to github, just opening pull requests
