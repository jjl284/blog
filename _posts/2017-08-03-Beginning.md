TODAY:
* gums are recovering well
* forgot to have breakfast and lunch, went to panda at 1
* migrating app to Expo + react-native
* got a mifi for my trip next week (verizon's website is soooo broken <.<)
* dropped by bank, got gas, groceries
* backpacking bag arrived!
* made a tasty veggie soup (see below)
* practiced guitar
* got a great pun from TJ
* my living room has white lights
  * attracts the bugs from outside at night
  * maybe 5% of them manage to find a crack to get inside
  * found ~20 of them perched on my ceiling
  * either switch to yellow bulbs, or use candles, or make a zapper controlled by my pi zero ...

TOMORROW:
* leftovers for lunch!
* dinner!
* should probably add comments/replies to this blog
  * looks like most people use disqus with jekyll, but disqus collects user data ...

LEARNED:
* expo
* react
* redux
* not to forget lunch
