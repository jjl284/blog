Our original manager when I joined was a people manager.  We eventually realized that one manager can not manage two dozen direct reports.  Hiring was a necessity, but hiring "bad managers" was very dangerous:
* an uninspiring manager means engineering loses its drive/passion
* an overbearing manager causes high performers to seek more impact elsewhere
* a manager that avoids accountability can't deliver




Suffice it to say, we brainstormed heavily on creating a good interview process for our engineering manager (eng mgr) candidates.

When hiring people managers, the types of questions asked tend to be much more focused on interactions and conflict resolution as opposed to technical architecture and problem solving.  As with any on-site one-on-one interview, we can either dive into the candidate's past and/or poke at hypothetical scenarios.  Both are necessary to offer insight into experience and potential, but both can be very biased if you aren't careful in how questions are asked.

My typical flow went something like this for such interviews:
# Describe system architecture overview
  * test for technical understanding and areas of interest
  * test if they understand business/product perspective
  * can they spot frictions between teams
# Ask about their path from IC to management role
  * are they managing just because it's on the "career path"?
  * how do they balance the needs from within the team with external requests?
  * how do they evaluate teams and initiatives?
# Dive into conflict resolution scenarios
  * what happens when a project may miss a deadline?
  * inter-team conflicts (e.g. release team blocks a promised delivery date)
  * intra-team conflicts (e.g. senior developer doesn't appreciate perspectives from junior developer)
# Career path and motivation
  * how do you if team members are dissatisfied?
  * what happens when individuals want new roles/responsibilities?

In the end, evaluation for a people manager tends to be more subjective than technical interviews where correctness is more obvious.  There are certain signs which can clearly indicate a candidate that won't jell with the team though.  The ones that I most commonly used to justify passing on a candidate were:
* lack of interest/passion in developing individuals
* inability to admit failure
* lack of structure for fairly evaluating individuals and/or teams
  * this usually meant they didn't actually know what initiatives were working or not
* obsession with metrics (e.g. story points or LOC)
  * this is usually coupled with an inability to explain why those metrics mattered to ICs
  * this also usually correlated with excessive process (e.g. the religious scrum adherent)




 certain responsibilities including: hiring and retention for a team, career development for individuals, accountability for the performance of the team (and features/products owned).  However, (after interviewing around ~50 from an IC perspective), there tend to be two different types of managers:
