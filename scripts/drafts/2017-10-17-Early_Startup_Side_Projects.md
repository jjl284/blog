So, the history of my foray into this startup business.

Four of us (1 pm, 1 -be, 1 -fe, and 1 designer) started working on a messaging app for small/medium businesses.  Why?

My forte is NLP and ML.  Those two are useless without data.  Best way to get natural communication is if you own the channel of communication.  Hence, build a chat app.

We built it using Twilio and Firebase in a few weeks but then needed a target demographic.

From here, we started brainstorming of easier ways to get data.

Idea 2 was ... a knowledge source scraper.  ended up reading emails to figure out who knows what.

Idea 3 was even more fun, playing with recommendation systems.  A certain insect-like company has a LOT of interesting data and we wrote a recommendation system for them.
