Hello!

This site is built with <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.

The theme is <a href="https://github.com/wild-flame/jekyll-simple">Simple</a> by <a href="http://wildflame.me">wildflame</a>

[Check out the blog here](https://wko27.github.com/blog) :)

If you'd like to fork this project, please be aware that there's a .gitignored credentials directory containing a few things to handle comment uploading:
* oauth secret api key
* stored oauth access token for the gmail account
* GitHub personal access token

Take a peek at [scripts/comment.py](https://github.com/wko27/blog/blob/master/scripts/comment.py) to see how these are used.

Cheers,
Andrew
