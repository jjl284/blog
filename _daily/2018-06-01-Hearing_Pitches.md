YESTERDAY:
* pho for lunch
* reimplemented app to connect to ssv2 board
* Taiwanese for dinner with sis
* debugging robot vacuum cleaner

TODAY:
* attended ~20 pitches by FinTech startups
  * excessive note taking
* quick lunch
* nap
* got BTLE reads and writes working cleanly in Android
* super easy yoga class
  * good stretches
* "healthy" dinner in Cupertino
* late night working
  * figured out how to set up characteristic notifications
  * broke a USB cable (oops)

LEARNINGS:
* Nordic dev zone being down all day really hurts productivity
  * Google cache is unreliable since some of the responses are AJAX-ified or link to non-indexed pages
