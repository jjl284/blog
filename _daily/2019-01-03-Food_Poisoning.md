YESTERDAY:
* woke up at 5 am to catch sunrise over the lake
* delicious Shan noodles for breakfast
* head out towards Taunggyi (Big Mountain), a major city
  * fun ride up the mountain
* visited a local religious cave
  * charged $20 foreigner fee each ...
  * heavily guarded by soldiers with pew pews
  * saved questions for the car ride back, but those were a militia faction that were not part of the official government
* visited two more temples
* lunch at a very local fried chicken outdoor place
  * this is where we suspectd 5 out of the 8 people got food poisoned
  * Yuting didn't eat anything and was fine
  * Suse was already sick
  * Tett ate everything but was unscathed
  * rest of us felt effects within 5-12 hours
  * on retrospective, we think it might have been the chickpea soup which was lukewarm and possibly stagnant
* visited Tett's relatives that live in the city
* checked into hotel
* head to dinner, but two members of the group dropped out not feeling well
  * I ended up feeling my stomach roiling upon arrival at the restaurant and immediately fled to the bathroom
  * threw up twice in the next hour and avoided all food
  * ended up getting chills throughout the rest of the night
* Suse got me a lovely sweater to keep me warm
* slept as soon as we got back to hotel

TODAY:
* next morning, everybody was reporting vomiting and diarrhea
* I threw up again by the side of the road outside a convenient store
  * drank some 100 Plus (Asian version of Gatorade) to replenish some salts
* took us a while but found some simple oatmeal to soothe our stomachs
* left Taunggyi around 11 am
* ~8 hour drive to Bagan, region famous for temples
  * slept almost the entire way
  * ate half a roll of crackers
  * woke up with my stomach complaining about lack of food and pain on sides of the lower back

LEARNINGS:
* food poisoning sucks
