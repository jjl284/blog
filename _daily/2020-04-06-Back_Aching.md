YESTERDAY:
* woke up around noon with back feeling funny
  * no tingling in legs which is good
  * weird dull pain in the center of my lower back
  * spent 30 minutes trying different positions
  * psoas massage and lying on my side eventually eased the pain away
* black bean spare ribs for lunch
* finished writing a unit test
* guzzled tons of water
  * Jackie needed water to be a specific temperature to make yeast for pizza
  * she kept pouring hot water into my cup!
* delicious pizza for dinner
  * gouda cheese!
* finished season 1 of A Good Place
* played Codenames online!
