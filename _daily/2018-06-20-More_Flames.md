YESTERDAY:
* woke up groggy
* frozen dumplings and a spinach omelette for lunch
* successfully implemented approach #3 from last night
  * even wrote some proper tests for it :D
* went for a three mile run
  * started feeling right knee on the way back ...
* meeting with hardware contractor
  * petted two super friendly dogs
  * tiny but hypoallergenic
* made a delicious pork chop and stir-fried green beans on the side for dinner
  * accidentally set the wok on fire again, 2nd time in two weeks :(
* discovered one of my bananas got moldy!!

TODAY:
* bad memory write issue :P
  * haven't done that in a decade ...
* chick-fil-a for lunch
* guitar lesson
* met with hardware contractors
  * realized I miss the camaraderie/banter that you get between engineering team members q.q
* late night roaming in the park with a friend
  * had to escape an accosting European lady with a tiny dog
* pho for dinner
* shared codebase with contractor
  * so of course I freaked out and started cleaning up stuff before he sees it :P
* super careful brushing of teeth

LEARNINGS:
* how flash really works
  * bits can only be fiddled to 0 state, by default they are in 1
* optimization tricks for CPU usage in embedded
* PPI logging can't be disabled in nRF5 SDK v15
  * fix is to change line 47 of nrfx_ppi.c to "#define NRFX_LOG_MODULE PPI"
* how to set up GPG
  * since apparently some GitHub repos only accept signed pull requests
