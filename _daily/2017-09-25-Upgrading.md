TODAY:
* broke my ios build, so I decided to upgrade React Native versions!
* pho for lunch
* restocked my fridge!
  * going to experiment with coconut oil instead of butter
* rock climbing
  * found a youth bouldering competition at PG Sunnyvale
  * those kids are super flexible!
* more vietnamese for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* difference between xcode project and workspace
  * basically, if you use Pods then you need to open the workspace in XCode for the IDE to recognize the pods
