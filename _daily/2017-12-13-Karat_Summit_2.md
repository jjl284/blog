YESTERDAY:
* Karat pitch deck + sell
* sessions on diversity, scalability, so reminiscent of Medallia
* got a personal tour of downtown Seattle by a friendly native
* sang karaoke with a great group of semi-strangers
* almost got through the day without thinking of her
* exercised self-discipline and I'm proud of this one :)
* helping three friends find a job

TODAY:
* visit Ann + Knut in Seattle!!
* bouldering @ [Seattle Bouldering Project](https://seattleboulderingproject.com/)!
  * accidentally ended up in a capoeira class
  * finally learned how to do a cartwheel!
* all-you-can-eat buffet! [Feast Buffet](https://feastbuffetrenton.com/)
  * so the Asian family at the next table wanted to take a group photo
  * the grandma was too busy destroying a huge pile of crab legs to join them
  * she clearly knows her priorities at a buffet :D
  * I gave her a nod of respect on the way to the restroom

LEARNINGS:
* how pointing out ignorance can really hurt somebody's feelings
* difference between Redshift and Aurora
  * Redshift uses a column-level storage optimized for reads on a subset of fields (similar to Citus)
  * Aurora is the more traditional row-level storage optimized for transactional reads and writes
