YESTERDAY:
* not too much traffic on way to work
* super sleepy, but stayed awake for 1-1
* power nap
* fun debugging macros
* dinner with Brian and Yibin
  * picked up ribs and corn-on-the-cob
  * I swear CA prices are crazy for corn
  * but I did grow up literally next to a cornfield
  * tasty avocado and mushroom burgers
* played a Robinson Crusoe cooperative board game
  * beat it way too easily

TODAY:
* dim sum with the gang!
