YESTERDAY:
* stayed up till 3 am last night cleaning up that normalization code
* woke up around 10 am
* dumplings for lunch
* coded for about 6 hours straight
  * mom wanted a new website name, so did a full refactor + deploy in ~2 hours
  * little trickiness with SSL certificate, forgot to add wildcard handling
  * added a difficulty bar (easy, medium, hard)
  * added verification of options from entering equations
  * refactored my variable editor (looked terribly unusable even I must admit)
* grocery store trip with dad
  * couldn't find ground pork at reasonable price, ended up paying $4/lb at Safeway q.q
* cooked dinner with Dad
  * scallops!
* switched to tire project
  * added gyro support
  * got halfway through adding a UI to more easily test sensors without restarting the app
  * uploaded a bunch of fake images for app beta deployment

TODAY:
* pitched to a super honest but smart Mexican lady
  * great feedback for us
* parents made a lovely batch of dumplings
* Amy's bday dinner
  * cherry pie for dessert except ...
    * amy is allergic to cherries
    * crust had butter, and I'm lactose
    * amy's friend has an almond allergy and it had almonds
* math website development
  * got demo working
  * added conditional logic to branches
  * added an alternative step for overeager students
  * added a barrier so we don't accidentally run a sync when testing

LEARNINGS:
* nested destructuring syntax in ES6!
* how to use Android Studio's UI editor
* ground pork is oddly expensive in bay area
* discovered template literals
  * not going to lie, this made me happy :)
