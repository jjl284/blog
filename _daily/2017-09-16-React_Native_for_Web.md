YESTERDAY:
* learning about some interesting recruiting practices for super secret side project #2
* volunteered at a friend's painting event in the city
  * super windy, had to tape everything down
  * sadly had to leave before finishing my painting :'(
* late evening workout at a park in Cupertino
  * failed attempt to pick up a breakfast burrito from Taco Bell

TODAY:
* super secret side project #2 continues! (I'll probably reveal what it is next week once I'm sure it's happening :P)
* abs + core class round 2!
  * careful not to pull anything this time
* guitar lesson
* late lunch @ chick-fil-a
* profile picture for side project #2
* finally got my web version of the app partially running
  * just needed to sprinkle in a bunch of technologies (see learnings below)
* bought some crazy expensive apples from Safeway; these better be delicious

LEARNINGS:
