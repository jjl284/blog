YESTERDAY:
* lunch w/ Yibin at Indian Street Cafe
  * they have these cute old automobiles that you can sit in to eat :D
  * also lunch buffet was surprisingly decent (although I don't have high standards with Indian food tbh)
* added a battery check to the app and tested it
* wrote a hardware spec
  * researched accelerometers and gyros
* couple naps
* went to yoga, first time all week
* climbing afterwards
  * two new V3s
  * fell at an awkward angle on my ankle so I decided to stop
* massive bowl of pho for dinner and everything's dandy :D

TODAY:
* guitar lesson
* skipped lunch by accident
* 5 hour strategy meeting with cofounder and a hardware engineer
* read a few fascinating research papers
  * including one on the "Tire Modle Magic Formula"
* laundry

LEARNINGS:
* as usual the physics got complicated, so they got a bunch of empirical data and made some formulas to approximate it very closely
  * the mathematician inside of me cringes, but the engineer applauds
* costs at least $5-10k to get a hardware engineer to design a board
* takes around 2-3 months to get it fabricated!
