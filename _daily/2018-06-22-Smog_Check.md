YESTERDAY:
* woke up randomly at 6 am and couldn't get a little music progression out of my head
  * downloaded a free app called MuseScore 2 and was able to jot it down
  * went back to sleep
* smog check in the morning
  * super easy and got a $15 off coupon :D
* researched FFTs on PDM output from digital mic
* yoga
  * handstand practice!
* lunch at Subway
* got UART to USB connector
  * rewrote UART driver, works properly
* fixed an annoying buffer overrun bug in my flash driver
* refactored Bluetooth command logic
* second Amazon locker pickup
  * battery on robot vacuum cleaner died
* steamed a fish
  * Brian made a scampi with fresh pasta to go with it
* smoothie to finish the last banana before I head to LA
  * finished some leftover green beans too
* paid my DMV registration bill
* ported data upload part from Android app into Python for a UART dump

TODAY:
* morning climbing
* lunch with an old friend
* drive to LA!
  * bringing Amy's violin and electric guitar down
  * also a super secret box of documents for my aunt
  * 7 hours
  * nap on a lovely beach south of San Luis Obispo
* had some of my parent's homemade rice dumplings for dinner!
* found out my parents have gotten into dehydrating random stuff
  * kitchen's full of jars of powdered ginger, scallions, okra, etc

LEARNINGS:
* the modulation for PDM is done on the sensor side in a digital microphone (which ... kinda makes sense)
