TODAY:
* woke up and found a fellow interviewer lost power
  * took on interview at last minute for her
* dumplings for lunch
* made my missing mustaches materialize
* went to my bikram class (haven't gone in a month)
  * apparently they switched the schedue, so I ended up in a "Yoga Sculpt" class
  * my glasses were off and I didn't notice until the instructor asked if we all had our weights
  * good workout anyway :P
* grocery shopping at Ranch 99
  * spent 10 minutes looking for sacha sauce and gave up :(
* baked salmon + veggies + rice + leftover Korean-fried cauliflower for dinner
* did a full db migration to new "schema"
  * added a backend verification test
  * added client-side validation
* fixed a bunch of minor bugs
* screw fell out of my chair
  * toothpick trick to fix!

LEARNINGS:
