YESTERDAY:
* 
* potluck!
  * more japanese curry
* ended up watching salad fingers oddly enough

TODAY:
* interview
* leftovers + a homemade Indian dish + Trader Joe soup dumplings = lunch
* drove up to work on stache
* dinner at Sandwich Stop in Redwood City
* saw Kingsmen
* collapsed four screens into two to simplify registration flow
* figured out that Slack animations run even when the window is hidden, causing my Firefox to eat up 65% of CPU ...

LEARNINGS:
* how flexbox works!
  * zomg it makes so much sense after you figure out what "flex: 1" means ...
* how to disable Slack animations, see [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/228023907-Turn-off-animated-images-and-emoji)
