YESTERDAY:
* dumplings for lunch
* up to the city to test prototype tread sensor
* got on-board memory storage for a one time recording with multiple sensors working
* met with GoodYear team, more understanding of POC + pilot progression
* climbing
  * finished my first V5

TODAY:
* brought sister to foot surgery
  * pharmacy meds pickup
  * panda for lunch
* started on dashboard UI
* presented to a Michelin research team and a guy from Ford
  * hm, hope Tim/Jose haven't found my blog yet ...
* found a new Korean restaurant in Cupertino Village
  * so we enter the restaurant and there's a handful of tables with customers
  * waiters/servers shout a hearty anasayo across the restaurant from the kitchen
  * Vlad being Vlad (tall Eastern European white guy), decides to shout back kamsamnida just as loud
  * the entire staff was amazed that he speaks Korean
  * other customers are staring at us like we're crazy walking into a restaurant and shouting
  * I apologized to the waiter but he was happy that Vlad spoke Korean
  * as we're eating, our servers were decidedly more hands-on helping to cut our food :p
  * pretty decent kalbi jim!
* grocery run

LEARNINGS:
* I should take pride in my friends that aren't ashamed to show appreciation for other cultures
