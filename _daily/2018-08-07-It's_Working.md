YESTERDAY:
* leftover baked chicken thighs
* bought new lug nuts for car
  * wearing out due to all the tire changes
* picked up $40 in quarters
  * then found out the next day that they just installed credit card machines in the laundry room
* finished penultimate and finale of Westworld season 2
* 1st dinner chicken wings
* 2nd dinner at Chinese bbq
* practiced guitar

TODAY:
* wrote a classifier in C
  * tested it by copying test values into source code (#define'd to avoid space waste when disabled)
  * and used a Google spreadsheet since I was too lazy to Python it up
* dropped off package to hardware engineer
* lunch with ex-colleague
  * amazing ramen at Ramen Nagi in Palo Alto
  * crazy long line though, arrived 15 mins before opening and already ~30 people on a Tuesday
  * food coma nap afterwards
* finished algorithm
* started making a beef neck bone soup
* vehicle testing and speed detection algorithm worked on first try!!
  * unfortunately I messed up the db layer
  * spent part of the night working on a cleanup script for all the test data gathered
* yoga class
  * learned some new stretches
  * tempted to climb afterwards, but way too busy
* finished making the soup
  * did not add salt this time
  * duck broth base was already pretty salty
* watched a documentary on the math behind camera motion in video games

LEARNINGS:
* add the potatoes at the end of the stew
* get out of the house at least once a day
