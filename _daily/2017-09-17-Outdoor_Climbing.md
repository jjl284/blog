YESTERDAY:
* archery tag!
  * apparently somebody called the police complaining about projectile weapons in the park
  * luckily the officer was pretty chill (even when they called his manager)
  * only one minor injury during the event, a cut from a direct eye hit
* red robin for lunch!
* helped out with AWS portion of a hardware project
* dumplings for dinner
* cleaned up a classy picture in a frame
* made a fresh batch of trail mix

TODAY:
* outdoor climbing @ Castle Rock State Park
  * hm, that ended up lasting about 6 hours longer than expected ...
  * bouldering + top-roped, super fun!
  * forgot to pack a lunch though, ended up with 2 bananas and a trail bar before 6 pm
* decided to take a day off from the app today
  * then spent an hour trying to implement a list view in react native for web

LEARNINGS:
* don't trust archived issues on GitHub
