YESTERDAY:
* new glasses finally arrived!
  * no headaches on the transition
* discovered Unity, a unit testing framework for C
* tons of testing with Tett
* missed a phone chat volunteer thing
  * sorry Gaby! :'(
* left work by 9
* ended up in a one hour phone conversation at the in-n-out's parking lot
* too late to climb, in-n-out for dinner and leftover wings
* bit of guitar practice

TODAY:
* got to work by 8 am
* listened in on a cagey duel
* breakfast at 9!
  * avocado toast?
  * bread had butter though ...
* goat curry for lunch
* showed my frontend engineer how to do a bit of perf breakdown and optimization
* bit of climbing
* finished my chives for dinner
  * with eggs
  * and a noodle soup
* checked those ridiculous prices for my trip to Barcelona
* watched a sad mini-documentary about a child who quit school to work in China to support her younger siblings

LEARNINGS:
* life isn't so bad
* might have actually practiced guitar every day of this week!
