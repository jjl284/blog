YESTERDAY:
* simple lunch
* went to a capoeira class
  * super fun group of people
  * pretty laid back in terms of workout though
* drove around Stanford trying to gather data
  * turns out the bump detector worked!
  * however, my Python code hit a connection reset error which wasn't gracefully handled
* finished 2nd chapter of integer problems for math website
* rewrote my parser for the 4th (?) time to handle adjacent variables
* replaced two lightbulbs that went out

TODAY:
* got live demo working, yay
* 4 hour meeting with lawyers on patents and trademarks
* handle connection reset properly
* finally finished a v4 been working on for a month :D
  * made a new friend!

LEARNINGS:
* differences between patents and trademarks
  * patents expire after 10 years, trademarks are perpetual as long as it is in use (on a product/service)
