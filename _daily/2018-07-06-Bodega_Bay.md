  * started data extraction
* day trip to Bodega Bay!
  * tasty lunch at a Fisherman's Cove
* rented a kayak and went down and up Salmon Creek
* flew a kite
* dinner at Great China in Berkeley
* found my legs got sunburned!
  * first time ... ever?

TODAY:
* smoothie
* ran into some fun with python firebase admin SDK
  * apparently there's a limit for single write
  * chunked and re-tried
* used up some spinach and tomato to make an omelette for brunch
* headed up to Oakland
  * spent 3 hours debugging broken boards with hardware expert
* met up with Tett and explored his new house
  * vintage Sears pull-out stove from the 1960s ...

LEARNINGS:
