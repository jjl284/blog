YESTERDAY:
* spent 4 hours practicing our pitch
* potluck at friend's place!
  * played a switch for the first time, very cool
  * worked on a jigsaw puzzle, super relaxing
* in n out

TODAY:
* pitched to 500 startups, an accelerator group in SF
  * great feedback, they seemed pretty interested, although I feel like we're still too early for them
* fancy sandwich for lunch
* re-learned how to do segmented linear regression and got my jupyter notebook + conda env set up
* replicated into EC2 and hooked up to database so we aren't lying when we see the analysis is done real-time in the cloud :P
* met with GoodYear team in person, two person tiny team, really enjoyed their personalities :)
* dinner w/ Mark and Kevin
* career advice + therapy session <.<

LEARNINGS:
* credentials do matter when introducing yourself to unknown people :(
  * I like to think that ideas should speak for themselves
  * there's definitely a reaction from the VCs/accelerators when I mention my degrees and background
