YESTERDAY:
* marinated pork ribs in the morning
* carpooled to work
* finally got health insurance covered by the startup!
* missed yoga :(
* carpooled back from work
* cooked a feast with a friend instead
  * chicken and shrimp porridge
  * stir-fried gai lan
  * burmese fried rice
    * finally used that packet from the trip
  * steamed pork ribs

TODAY:
* code reviews!
* went to a new yoga teacher
  * interesting accent!
  * pace was pretty slow, but possibly due to a packed class
  * turns out there was some sort of ... student club in attendance?
* grocery run
* leftovers for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* steamed pork ribs aren't too hard to make!
