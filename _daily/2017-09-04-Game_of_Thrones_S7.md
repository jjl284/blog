TODAY:
* got feedback from 2nd beta user!
* 2 hour hike at Fremont Older Preserve
  * testing out new backpack (atmost 65 AG) weighted with 20 lbs
  * super squeaky!
* dim sum
* watched entirety of GoT S7 in ~9 hours

LEARNINGS:
* R+L=J theory proven?
* how audio is transmitted over hdmi
  * more specifically why refreshing the screen refresh rate can help fix loss of audio when streaming
