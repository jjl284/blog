YESTERDAY:
* took car to servicing
  * fix the oil leak from that I caused
  * turns out they need to replace my clutch which is under a special warranty
* made a veggie soup
* napped for ~2 hours (might be a bit sick)
* second hot pot dinner in a row
* got my sensor's GPIO streaming to the app correctly! hooray!
* paid my car insurance bill q.q

TODAY:
* dim sum with the gang
* return borrowed multimeter to yeager
* got amazing Christmas gifts from sis
* laundry + nap
* built another website with co-founder
* registered on angelist
* learned a new yoga pose
* ended up climbing with same partner from last Saturday

LEARNINGS:
* you can negotiate your property valuation by the county within 2 years of purchase
  * this can drop your property tax by a lot!
* partner's name is Mike
  * slightly better chance of remembering it if I put it in here
* Vatayanasana - horse face pose
  * which reminds me of those terrible Sarah Jessica Parker memes from a few years back
