PREVIOUSLY:
* applied for an aigrant to do a little vision side project

TODAY:
* fixed deployment scripts, 12 seconds to build + deploy to prod!
  * user-data script must have a header (e.g. #!/bin/bash)
  * logs for cloud init on ec2 are in /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
  * installing jdk 8 on ec2 **for now**:
    * sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel && sudo yum -y remove java-1.7.0 && sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.141-1.b16.32.amzn1.x86_64/bin/java
* subway for lunch!
* reading up on ios notifications (sounds + badges + icons)
* a birthday at in-n-out and poker!
* fixed all the icons/loading screens

LEARNINGS:
* xcode works surprisingly well once you know the magical incantations
* fun with cloud init
* disable gradle daemon when building on t2.micro
