* decided to write new internal testing infra using Typescript + React
  * holy cow, types are super verbose for Redux ...
* meetings and such in the afternoon
* checked out WeWork space in San Mateo!
  * pretty nice, very convenient, but parking costs $15/day!!!
* dropped by Medallia office to say hi to folks
* first dinner w/ friends
* exchanged gifts with Suse (sand painting mixup when packing)
* second dinner w/ friend in SF

TODAY:
