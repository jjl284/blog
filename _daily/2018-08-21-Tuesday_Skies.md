YESTERDAY:
* early morning climbing
* super tired from previous day's bouldering
* forgot to eat lunch
* met with contractor, super productive meeting
* tire install
* tire testing
  * verified bug fix on timestamp issue
  * verified faster sampling gives decreased resolution
    * debating whether to handle on server-side or smooth it on board again ...
* free dinner at LinkedIn
  * gave a quick demo
* beautiful sunset
* helped a friend pack house to move
  * q.q. so much stuff

TODAY:
* lunch with a friend in Daly City
  * delicious Filipino food at Chibog
  * sensor failed on the drive up though :(
  * fixed a silly bug in mobile upload component in the parking lot
* follow-up with contractors
* refactored entire configuration management piece (firmware and Android side)
  * cleaned up a bunch of documentation and ... just bad code in general
* examined test data from research expert
* quick dinner with friends
  * one game of Betrayal at House on the Hill
* benchtop testing for configuration piece

LEARNINGS:
* my firmware and server-side code are kept orderly, but my Android code has been pretty weak in comparison
  * not sure why I've been slacking there; time to get back in shape!
