YESTERDAY:
* started on sample data extraction failsafe
  * basically a way to get data out so we have something to work with even if sensor extraction destroys the board
* documented case installation procedure
* bento for lunch with Yibin!
* cleaned out all my stuff from the office
  * got a parting picture with Sunjay
* dropped off boards at hardware contractor
* westworld
* made a lovely house description in case of AirBnB
* tested new recording device
* cleaned up condo
* guitar
* late night chat with hardware contractor
  * realized I installed the sensors upside-down during the run last week
  * explains all the hardware failures since the battery was in contact with all the peripherals -_-

TODAY:
* spent morning finishing up a sampling feature
  * discovered a data validation issue halfway through the morning
  * spent the next four hours debugging and fixing it
  * got it all done about 5 minutes after tire installer was scheduled to come
* second round of testing!
  * one hour of test drives
  * higher success rate this time
* hosted a dinner party
  * thai food
  * monopoly
    * which when played correctly was actually quite fun
  * late night discussions on life

LEARNINGS:
* never get boneless wings, bone-in only!!!
  * way too much breading :(
* in embedded lands, runtime validation checks can cause race conditions ...
  * very useful to have debug code warning if that race condition was ever hit
