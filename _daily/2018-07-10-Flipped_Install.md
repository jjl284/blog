YESTERDAY:
* started on sample data extraction failsafe
  * basically a way to get data out so we have something to work with even if sensor extraction destroys the board
* documented case installation procedure
* bento for lunch with Yibin!
* cleaned out all my stuff from the office
  * got a parting picture with Sunjay
* dropped off boards at hardware contractor
* westworld
* made a lovely house description in case of AirBnB
* cleaned up condo
* guitar
* late night chat with hardware contractor
  * realized I installed the sensors upside-down during the run last week
  * explains all the hardware failures since the battery was in contact with all the peripherals -_-

TODAY:
* 

LEARNINGS:
* never get boneless wings, bone-in only!!!
  * way too much breading :(
