YESTERDAY:
* power optimization meeting with firmware engineer
  * two dogs are so friendly :)
* guitar lesson
* leftovers for lunch
* watched a movie called Lady Bird
  * good acting
* missed my yoga class
* hot pot at a friend's place
  * played codenames and context (taboo with icons)
  * sleepover party!

TODAY:
* 5 min walk to dim sum
  * Tai Yuan Seafood Restaurant
  * pretty average
* caught up with one of my old teammates
  * played Alienation (like Helldivers, but with more permanent upgrades and no friendly-fire)
* stir-fried napa + shrimp and finished two rice dumplings

LEARNINGS:
* current state of [fusion reactors] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0KuAx1COEk)
* good to just not do things sometimes
* what hurt the most about my last relationship was not the rejection
  * it was that she needed help and I neither perceived it nor gave it
