YESTERDAY:
* interview
* mound of sauteed mushrooms + onions over rice + sausage for lunch
* six flags in the afternoon!
* delicious dinner at Chengdu Style Restaurant in Berkeley
  * crazy parking, but worth it
* stayed up until 2 am trying to figure out why my native modules weren't registered properly
  * ran into a fun bug where setTimeout never returns

TODAY:
* ~6.5 mile hike in Henry Coe State Park
* bbq for dinner
* rock climbing at the gym afterwards
* figured out my react native module issue (react native navigation) and fixed an Animated divide by zero error from react-native-scrollable-tab-view

LEARNINGS:
* setTimeout in the simulator basically says "take current time, add requested ms, and wake me up when we get there"
  * if your simulator has clock time set in the wrong timezone, then ... you'll probably be sad
  * set to PST via:
```
adb shell setprop persist.sys.timezone America/Los_Angeles
```
