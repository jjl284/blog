TODAY:
* got back from a short backpacking trip!
  * King's Canyon Rae Lakes Loop
  * total trip was supposed to be 40 miles from 8k to 12k feet
  * member of our party sprained his knee, so we stopped after 10 miles, spent a night and headed back

LEARNINGS:
* don't forget to bring utensils!
* how to use hiking poles correctly ... (needs a blog post)
