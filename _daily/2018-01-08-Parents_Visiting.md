YESTERDAY:
* power yoga in morning
* fixed website so it's a real-time display of pushed data
* visited office space at Plug n Play in Sunnyvale
* visited potential office space in an apt complex in Sunnyvale
* parents arrived!
  * showed mom her website present
* found inconsistent unicode characters for subtraction symbol
  * added normalization code, tests, and a db migration

TODAY:
* took Amy + her friend to rock climbing
* sushi for lunch
* washed yoga mat
* refactored my parser to handle weird cases with derivatives
  * in the expression d/dx, d should not be considered a variable
  * added a ton of proper unit tests

LEARNINGS:
* avoid asking about the price early on in negotiations as the buyer (sometimes)
* erm, I should remember to water my plants xD
  * mom found my dried up bamboo by the window sill ...
* proper way to floss my teeth!
  * slightly sad that it took me this long, but I've realized that I should use the floss to scrape the inner sides of my tooth ...
