YESTERDAY:
* got up around 6:30 am for early meeting
* nap by 11 am
* puzzled pint!
  * super late again :(
* bachata!
  * lots of twinges but no sharp pains ...
  * need to practice a ton :(

TODAY:
* helped Jackie attempt to debug a broken lock
  * cheap Chinese electronic lock
  * looks like either a firmware bug or an electrical short (stuck key)
  * device remained powered but not responsive on button presses

LEARNINGS:
* new lockpick set wasn't very useful on an electronic lock
