YESTERDAY:
* set up a spreadsheet for camping trip
* packed everything
  * remembered my aunt's shady box of papers to be delivered to a friend in the bay area
  * last minute plant watering
* lunch at Mian with other wedding-goers
  * spicy Chinese noodles!
* head back to Bay Area
  * straight shot, no stops or naps
  * used a Cliff bar to stay awake
* got to gym just in time for an abs class
* wings with Thorvald for dinner
* watched first episode of Mr. Robot
  * almost realistic hacking!
  * only mistake we caught was a 300 in an IP address (which makes no sense since that would require 9 bits ...)

TODAY:
* early morning yoga
  * wasn't fully awake for that
* sync on ssv3 dock v2 testing
* Sunjay requested some slides to answer specific questions
  * made them in an hour and added to deck
  * straight into a call with investor
  * 2.5 hours of endless question barrage
  * pages of notes
* quick dumplings for lunch
* sync on plans for wed/thurs/fri
  * realized a conflict with my parents arriving from HK
* nap
* dropped off mini-van at office
* hitched a ride back with a friend
  * Oyako-don for dinner along the way
* soldering + 3.5 hour chat with Yeager in his garage
  * learned all about the latest shortcomings of TensorFlow
  * got all the juicy gossip on research efforts since I left

LEARNINGS:
* how thorough investors try to be
  * unclear to me whether the content or delivery of the response matters more
  * but now I get why Sunjay is so stressed about things
