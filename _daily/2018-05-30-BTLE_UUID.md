YESTERDAY:
* finished my last pork steak for lunch
  * not going to buy those again any time soon ... so fatty
* made a beef stew from scratch
* made a chicken stock too!
  * accidentally cooked it for ~7 hours total and ended up with super condensed broth
* dinner with Brian and Knut
* cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2
  * puns almost made it worth the time ...

TODAY:
* up to the city for work!
* tasty sandwich for lunch
* finally figured out what sd_ble_uuid_vs_add really does ...
  * <.< it's basically a local cache of 128-bit UUIDs
  * you pass in a pointer to your 128-bit UUID, and a pointer to the "type" field of a ble_uuid_t struct
  * it populates that "type" field with an 8-bit key
  * you populate the "uuid" field of the ble_uuid_t struct with your own chosen 16-bit identifier
  * tada, now you can pass your 16-bit identifier
* awesome yoga class
* dropped by grocery store
* worked on a poem
* dumplings and stew for dinner
  * with an acai smoothie + super organic granola for dessert

LEARNINGS:
* finally hit that 31 byte limit on the advertising stack
* nordic softdevice stack has a struct called ble_advdata_t
  * "uuids_complete" is the list of all service UUIDs broadcast by the device
  * "uuids_more_available" is a shortened list of some of the services broadcasted
    * presumably the rest of them can be obtained via scan response packets
  * "uuids_solicited" is a hint to the connecting device of which services the device wants to consume
