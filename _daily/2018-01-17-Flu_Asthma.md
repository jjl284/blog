DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY:
* slept till noon
* drove up to SF to meet with an old coworker who works in educational software for SF's school district
* drove back
* dumplings for dinner
* massive migraine
* actually took medicine to sleep more easily

YESTERDAY:
* tried to learn some CSS to implement new login screen
* couldn't focus enough
* did two db migrations instead and added tests
* slept away the afternoon
* dragged myself out to get pho for dinner
* finished entire season of Houseki No Kuni

TODAY:
* lunch with a friend
* more sleep
* woke up and did a little shower meditation
* dumplings for dinner
* debugging on AWS lambda + alexa
  * took me an hour to realize the code I uploaded wasn't actually being run
  * somehow my slow upload speed is causing some issue ... will retry tmr @ library
* literally spent 2 hours making a semi-circle in CSS for my login page
  * but I finally understand how flex-basis works ^.^

LEARNINGS:
* asthma + flu thing is really an annoying combo
