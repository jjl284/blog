YESTERDAY:
* panera's for dinner
* replacement sensors finally arrived in the afternoon
* demo prep
* massive bowl of pho for dinner

TODAY:
* burrito for lunch
* 2nd POC demo to GoodYear
  * not quite as smooth as first demo
  * connectivity issue :(
* dinner with friends
  * met a software engineer who worked on the M3D, a 3d printer I bought on Kickstarter a while ago
* played a board game about terraforming mars
  * pretty fun, but almost no way to know who's winning since there's so many ways to get points

LEARNINGS:
* really need to find a hardware person
