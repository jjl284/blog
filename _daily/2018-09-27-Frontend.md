YESTERDAY:
* back to frontend development
* yoga class
* late night pho for dinner
* watched the claimed proof of the Riemann Hypothesis
  * Atiyah's proof relies on the existence of a special function that he calls the Todd function
  * this function has a combination of a lot of properties
  * but his lecture gave very little detail on proving whether the function itself can exist
* sync with designer and hardware engineer

TODAY:
* got back to frontend development
  * finished one out of three views (without design edits)
* mistimed my yoga class
* went to an abs class at 8:30 pm instead
  * starving by 9:30 pm
  * devoured a two person meal at Ming Tasty
  * listened to a crowd of Chinese seniors celebrating an event
    * lots of singing and happiness

LEARNINGS:
* appreciating how quickly the code/test cycle is in frontend world
