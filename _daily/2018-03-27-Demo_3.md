YESTERDAY:
* cleaning up code
* lots of testing in parking lot
* bit of climbing
* had the weirdest dream about trying to win free Hersheypark tickets from some sort of scratch-off lottery ticket

TODAY:
* picked up sister and gave her a ride to Medallia
  * ended up seeing engineering presentations from a one-day hackathon
  * some of those projects definitely took more than a day though!
* spent 2 hours prepping demo to GoodYear vp of innovation
  * three perfect tests
  * then I discovered some last minute bugs in the data set
    * inverted values from accelerometer z-axis
    * suspecting the sensor got detached and flipped over?
  * deployed some last minute hack fixes
  * then turns out the rep just wanted to chat about specific changes to our proposal instead of seeing the demo
* picked up an old high school friend and met up with my sister for dinner
  * the line for dessert at Icicles was over 30 mins
  * lovely to see somebody from so long ago!

LEARNINGS:
* it's been a month since I've thought "she would have loved this"
