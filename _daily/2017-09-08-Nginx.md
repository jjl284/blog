YESTERDAY:
* forked AssetServlet to more correctly handle nested jars produced from OneJar
* switched to a different app website template
* rock climbing in Belmont
  * finally renovating the bathroom!

TODAY:
* redeployed everything
* automated nginx 80 to 8080 forwarding
* wrassled with multi-part terraform cloud init templates
* automated deployment of said nginx via user data
  * hint: it only really works if you actually use cloud-init cfg files
  * if you try to concatenate other files, it'll add a MIME header before each part
  * you can work around this with by specifying merge_type = append(list)
  * ended up just making a separate shell script for services that require such fanciness
* parents arrived!
* family dumpling party
* found out my peaches got moldy!! :'(

LEARNINGS:
* nginx basics
