YESTERDAY:
* learn AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild
  * fixed my frontend unit tests while I was at it
  * apparently, the lovely javascript folk have built this thing called node-gyp
  * it's a cross-platform command-line tool that requires a C/C++ compiler
  * on MacOS, it also requires Python 2.7 and throws very odd errors if you have Python 3 on by default
  * fix was to use `npm config set python python2.7`
* lovely walk around the block with Dad
  * visited an empty Home Depot
* sent out new years cards!

TODAY:
* 

LEARNINGS:
* JUnit 5!
  * restrained myself and did not attempt an upgrade
* how to aggregate JUnit reports in a multi-module Gradle project
