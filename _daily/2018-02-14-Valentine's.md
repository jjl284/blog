YESTERDAY:
* made a porridge
  * added a can of corn for funsies, but then it took twice as long to boil away and was too watery :'(
* finished half of chapter 3 problems
* added code to allow different configurations per sensor on Android testing app
* made a progress indicator
* gathered a bunch of data
* finger still recovering so no workout, partial guitar practice
* discovered the COMMAND secret item in Risk of Rain and immediately beat the game with a character <.<
  * been working on this for at least a month ...

TODAY:
* tried not to think about her
* got a like on my react-mathjax GitHub
  * felt slightly guilty about it
  * cleaned up documentation
  * published it properly on (npm)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mathjax2]
* discovered that I wasn't cleaning up remote timers on my sensors correctly
  * fixed that issue and a bunch of connection issues stopped occurring :P
* found another potential alpha user
* started implementing progress tracking to math app
* started an auto-generation system for equation graph to save time
  * spent ~8 hours this week building problems manually before this got too tedious xD
* spent 2 hours in the library trying to hack together a UI + redux state for combining batches recorded with overlapping timestamps
  * the issue is I don't really record proper end timestamps (and doing so would be unreliable)
  * this sounds like an interview question <.<
  * anyway, ended up with a very hacky solution but w/e it works for now ...
  * guilty again, so I ended up designing how I would do this properly and found a bunch of fun edge cases that we'll have to handle eventually
* learned a new yoga pose
  * half camel - great back bend
  * a bit too many "love yourself on valentine's day" quotes from the teacher though
* finger is almost better
* made a tomato egg scramble + veggies + lap cheung fan dinner

LEARNINGS:
* desperation fuels ingenuity
