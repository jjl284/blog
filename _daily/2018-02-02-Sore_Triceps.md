YESTERDAY:
* Google for lunch :D
* ended up taking a weirdly long nap with dreams
* dropped by Medallia
  * tasty hot pot place for dinner

TODAY:
* finally got sensor installed inside tire!
  * used an epoxy and some crazy metal binding gel
  * super friendly but responsible car shop guy
* captured a bunch of sample data points
  * time for some fun data analysis!
* bouldered for an hour, then ended up top-roping for 2 more
  * 12c killed my triceps, did not finish :'(
* found contentment sitting at home, eating mom-made dumplings and appreciating my purpose in life

LEARNINGS:
* think I've moved on :)
