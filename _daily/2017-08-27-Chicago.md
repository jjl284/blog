YESTERDAY:
* drove to St. Louis
* visited the arch!
* drove to Chicago
* dinner at Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffle

TODAY:
* architecture walking tour!
* jimmy's red hot for lunch
* 3 hour nap
* deep dish for dinner!
  * I stuck with a meatball sandwich, bowl of fruit, and chicken noodle soup

LEARNINGS:
* nobody died in the creation of the St. Louis arch
* difference between a nemesis and an arch-nemesis
* Jekyll by default shows posts with a reverse ordering
  * To do the same for a separate collection, simply use:
~~~
    {% assign sorted = (site.[collection name] | sort: 'date') | reverse %}
    {% for post in sorted limit:10 %}
~~~
