YESTERDAY:
* lunch with an old colleague
* made a beef broth!
  * forgot an onion at the beginning
  * also boiled off half of it before I noticed ...
* used the broth to make a beef stew
  * part of the reason for this is because my friend gave me a loaf of bread
  * used my bread knife for the second time in 5 years?
  * finished half the loaf by dipping in stew :D
* massive nap
* laundry
* stayed up until 2 am trying to finish some code
  * went to sleep unfinished q.q

TODAY:
* went in early to work for a meeting
  * meeting delayed to tomorrow
* fixed that code issue
* implemented an offline feature to avoid demo snafus
* lunch at Subway's
* trying to figure out how to get the app version id in Nordic's SDK for a verification check
  * not really necessary since I got DFU working ...
* initial v3 test drive to great success!
* abs workout to celebrate
* overdid it for dinner
  * stir-fried eggs, gailan, honey bbq pork
  * beef stew with udon, another half a loaf of bread, and a bunch of hotpot ingredients in my freezer
  * think it was too many carbs xD

LEARNINGS:
* initialism vs acronym
