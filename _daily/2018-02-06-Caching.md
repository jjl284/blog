YESTERDAY:
* lunch with friends
* late night yoga class
* made a massive steak for dinner
* wrote a caching layer, worked beautifully on 2nd try :D
* wrote and deployed Python service to do classification
* fixed battery indicator in Android app

TODAY:
* cereal and pbj sandwiches for lunch
* target run for toilet paper + bump data capture
  * turns out 4 pm is a terrible time to get high speed bump data on 101 SB
* Seapot for dinner!
* got a real-time analysis pipeline set up storing events detected every 5 seconds into Firebase
  * live testing tomorrow

LEARNINGS:
* really starting to lose track of the days :(
* your car will average about 0.2 Gs of vertical acceleration when you hit a pothole/speedbump
