LEARNINGS:
* caffeine is a laxative!
* also discovered a bunch of useful Google Maps features that I never noticed
  * there's a little red arrow that points up or down
    * this tells you if traffic is increasing or decreasing towards your destination
  * there's also a P that tells you how easy parking is at the destination!
