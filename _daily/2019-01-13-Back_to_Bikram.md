* finished booking another section of upcoming May cruise trip
* drive to office to pick up my car
  * car transmission acting odd
* posted photos from Burma trip

  * too many scratches though :(

TODAY:
* returned 500 lbs of dumbbells to Walmart

  * super crowded!
* farewell lunch for Yaokai
  * crazy crowded at Little Sheep
  * also overdid it with food
