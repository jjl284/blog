YESTERDAY:
* relearned Sperner's lemma (and its proof)
* got obd2 data streaming to cloud
* formally gave up on using Ford's PID codes to get access to tire pressure
  * will retry this at a later date if we really need it ...
* found a cool video explaining how to decode the raw RF signal coming from TPMS

TODAY:
* spent morning on finishing UI cleanup tasks
* afternoon creating a proper technical roadmap doc
* dinner w/ friends
  * four course meal spread over 2 hours :P
  * delicious crab soup!
* started on my taxes
  * turbo tax sent me a 50% off discount code
  * guess they got me ACTIVATED (reading too much about AARRR)

LEARNINGS:
* how to split rent between roommates!
