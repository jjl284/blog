YESTERDAY:
* morning interview
* new BBQ called QBB on Castro St.
  * tasty, but very loud in the restaurant (friend and I were yelling at each from 5 ft away)
* another round of UAT
  * found a cleaner way to do the header nav thing on Android, but alas my title is flush with the status bar and there's no way to add margin/padding
* got an hour of ping-pong in at the gym

TODAY:
* friend visiting!
* Disney museum
* Sausalito
* super burger for lunch (very oily, but tasty!)
* tour through Berkeley
* ended exploring an open house (only 1 million for 4 BR/3BA)
* Devil's Slide Trail
* down PCH to 84, up 280 back to Millbrae
* Broadway Bistro for dinner
* found the cute Ghibli decorations at Sweet Indulgence

LEARNINGS:
