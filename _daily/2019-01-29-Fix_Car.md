YESTERDAY:
* added a feature that was missing for ages
* found a missing phone in my car
* also found my bracelet for yoga @ Stanford for the quarter
* lunch with an ex-colleague
  * reminiscing and rumoring :D
* head to office
* got a demo working 5 minutes before guest arrived
* fascinating conversation with a business development specialist
* Mr. Robot with Mr. Natvig
  * unhealthy amount of leftovers and wings
* guitar practice

TODAY:
* 8 am servicing for car
  * I'm at 99,000 miles and the warranty is good up to 100k :D
  * unfortunately, my car is at 7.5 years and the extended warranty was only good up to 7
  * also, the clutch that they replaced last year only has a warranty of 12 months and I'm at 13
  * also also, the only "fix" they can recommend is buying a new clutch for $2800 and it'll only last between 2 months to 2 years
  * on the bright side, they fixed my recall issue within an hour
* drive to work
* Subway for lunch
* begin Android app rewrite!
  * learning about all sorts of fun things
* climbing date went pretty well

LEARNINGS:
* realized that in an audition, they say "break a leg" because they "want you in the cast"!!!
* flexboxlayout in Android
