YESTERDAY:
* made kalbi short ribs for dinner
* saved the bones to make a bone broth

TODAY:
* used up ox tail to make an oxtail soup
  * only 1 lb of oxtail this time
  * we added one serrano pepper, cut in half with exposed seeds
  * I plucked it out afterwards and the entire stew was still super spicy

LEARNINGS:
* serrano peppers are amazing
