YESTERDAY:
* fixed a bug in commenting (fun with python byte strings)
* made a veggie stew!
* wrote my own email signature parser
  * hint: mailgun's open source one is ... not that great
* researched PostgreSQL's text search features

TODAY:
* applied for health insurance
* more mail parsing
  * getting back into the nlp thing
  * tempted to write an ML-based approach for signature parsing ... but let's do the easy, mostly working hack for now

LEARNINGS:
* need proof of termination to switch health insurance plans out of open enrollment period
