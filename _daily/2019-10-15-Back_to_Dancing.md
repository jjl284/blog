YESTERDAY:
* got to work early
* crunch crunch crunch
* back to bachata!
  * hooray!
  * minimal pain
* late night Korean for dinner
  * duk boki and a tofu soup!

TODAY:
* dinner with Brian and a friend of Elle's!
  * little sheep, soooo tasty
* watched an anime called Cells at Work
* hm, had a super awkward conversation with Jackie's roommate
  * super disappointed in two people's behaviors
    * avoiding responsibility when something bad happens
    * choosing to value personal property over friendship
    * avoiding conflict and acquiescing instead of standing up for principles

LEARNINGS:
* Hankook actually means Korean!
  * totally should have known this from the Cantonese word for Korea
* json parsing in C
* push/pull concept applies in bachata!
  * also, turns should be minimal
