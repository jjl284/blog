YESTERDAY:
* Eddie and I start taking antibiotics (Norbactin, 400 mg once every 12 hours, for 72 hours)
* woke up at 5 am again to hit up 4 famous pagodas
  * supposedly, one should see all four before noon in a single day
  * boat ride to the first included a sunrise view
* finished all four temples by 11 am and then visited two more
  * all temples must be visited barefoot
  * most of the temples are not well protected from tourism and suffer from vandalism or environmental damage
  * a recent earthquake caused significant damage to several structures
* purchased two sand paintings at markets outside
* one member of our party left early to head back to China
* watched the sunset from atop a viewing temple
* puppet show dinner
  * a little cat curled up on Suse's foot to nap throughout the meal
  * turns out the cat was not ok, probably very sick :(

TODAY:
* visited a few more temples in the morning
  * some had mostly intact wall paintings, but most were fading
* early evening flight back to Yangon
* repack everything for last part of trip

LEARNINGS:
* bunch of Burmese phrases
* sadness of lost culture as travelers don't respect the historical temples of Bagan
