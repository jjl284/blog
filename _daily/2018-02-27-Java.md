YESTERDAY:
* got a weird timestamp offset issue in one data set from one sensor out of 9 runs yesterday
  * ended up spending 2 hours digging into the API code to figure out what's going on
  * my conclusion is that while the API code is terribly written, the bug probably came from the board (using a bad logging ID)
* yoga class
* dropped by sister's place to swap out minivan for sports car for CarDash servicing
* did a refactor to simplify my bolts usage logic (less nested callbacks)

TODAY:
* unfortunately, latest version of my code stopped working
  * works fine in streaming and connected logging modes, but not in disconnected logging
* laundry + make porride for lunch + debug
* spent 4 hours attempting resets
  * accidentally put in battery upside down <.< that wasted 10 minutes
* read a (short story)[https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/]
* rock climbing
* dinner with sister, then drive home and swap sports car for minivan for ... yet another CarDash servicing
* started porting analysis code back to Java
  * oh thank god, a sane typed language with an IDE with efficient shortcuts
* around midnight, I figured out my bug
  * one line of code had to be moved two lines up ...

LEARNINGS:
* I miss Java terribly (more the IDE support rather than the language)
  * viewing call hierarchies
  * seeing what types implement/extend other classes/interfaces
  * rename refactors
  * useful compiler warnings/errors
