YESTERDAY:
* woke up at 9 am
* immediately started coding
* picked up package from hardware contractor
  * got good testing data long the way
  * picked up a weird burrito for lunch on the way back
    * bbq chicken and mashed potatoes??
    * definitely had dairy, but wasn't gassy until evening
* furious refactoring
  * separated out my data streams more cleanly
  * also kept my peripherals more cleanly disabled since they should never be mutually enabled
  * did this verrrrry carefully since I don't have proper tests on this
* ran out of time, couldn't squeeze in a test drive
* yoga at Stanford
* dinner at Chinese restaurant on Castro St.
  * different food choices than usual, but very tasty
* listened to an investment discussion between two friends while coding into the night
* early sleep

TODAY:
* 7 am climbing with friend!
  * rushed home by 8:30 am to find out 10 am meeting was cancelled
* did more testing after refactor and fixed a bug
* sent out two emails for work (haven't done that in a while)
* healthy bowl of soup for lunch
* prepared a lovely spreadsheet documenting data analysis results
* tire shop in the afternoon
  * tire mechanic called me their VIP :P
* drive up to city around 4 pm
* bike to dinner with GoodYear folks
  * lomo saltado at Lim√≥n
  * super salty, drank a ton of water
* biked back to Sunjay's
* got a great data set on the way home

LEARNINGS:
* these business dinners are soooo awkward
  * so many oblique questions and deflected answers
  * still really like the GoodYear team though
