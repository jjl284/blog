YESTERDAY:
* backend refactor on analysis pipeline
* salad for lunch
* go-karting
  * lost terribly in final race
  * got hit and spun out twice :P
* delicious schwarma wraps at Bucharest Grill for dinner

TODAY:
* implemented a nifty timestamp synchronization algorithm
* salad again for lunch
* flight back to Bay Area
  * McDonald's for dinner at airport
* layover at Vegas
  * forgot about the slot machines inside the airport
  * second flight was next to two drunk and chatty teenagers
  * literally got a headache even with earplugs
  * Lyft ride from Oakland to Mountain View was blissfully peaceful
* got to bed around 3 am

LEARNINGS:
* apparently the aisle seat armrests DO fold up!
  * there's a lock on the bottom at the connecting joint with the seat
  * might only apply to the specific type of aircraft
