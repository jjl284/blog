YESTERDAY:
* morning yoga class
* first time on a snowmobile!
  * they call them "snowmachines" out here
* visited the North Pole, a small town in Alaska
* progress on secret project!
  * debugged and fixed a bunch more issues in react-mathjax
  * ported assignment logic
  * created deployment automation scripts
  * added HTTPS + cloudfront to site

TODAY:
* guided tour to the Arctic Circle
  * super friendly guide
  * retired but has worked in the mining and trucking industries
  * sang us two songs that he wrote
* saw the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
* crossed the Yukon river
* saw more northern lights (very weak though)

LEARNINGS:
* Alaskan king crab fishing is one of the most dangerous jobs in Alaska
  * very short season but in the harshest of winter conditions
  * freezing sea water can accumulate on a ship causing imbalances and capsizes
* Iron Dog like the Iditarod but for snowmobiles!
* frost heave is a local term referring to bumps in the road caused by ice expansion from permafrost
* mining operations often open during the winter seasons
  * regulation requires minimal disturbances to the tundra (local terrain)
  * hence, transportation of equipment is done by building ice roads which melt away in spring instead of permanent roads
  * to build an ice road, they collect "ice chips" by scraping a lake/river
  * these ice chips are placed over the tundra, then sprayed with water which freezes to produce an ice road
