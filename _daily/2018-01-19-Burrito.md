YESTERDAY:
* helped a friend pass the driving exam!
* took a power yoga class to help with breathing
* added account validation testing
* considered doing a refactor on my db keys but decided against it
  * so, each "equation state" contains a "template" that looks like "a + b = c"
  * each of those variables will be assigned a fixed value when we generate an actual equation to solve
  * in this case, we need a and b to be constants and c to be a variable, so we also include a "templateVariableTypes" map that provides types for each variable
  * this (template, templateVariableType) is an identifier for an equation state
  * however, two things are of interest:
    * first, Firebase doesn't support complex keys
    * more importantly, "a + b = c" and "b + c = d" should identify the same equation state so long as the variable types are the same
  * so, I generate an "equation state key", a unique identifier for an equation state that looks like {a}+{b}={c'}
    * variable names are first-come-first-assigned
    * a "'" suffix is attached to variables that are of variable type
  * if I ever want to introduce more types, e.g. real numbers, it might be better to include type info directly, e.g. {a:int}+{b:int}={c:var}
  * I considered changing this because there's a one-to-one mapping between (template, templateTypeVariables) and (equationStateKey)
  * pros/cons:
    * size?
      * Firebase keys have a limit of ~700 bytes, which shouldn't matter since my equations hopefully never get that massive
      * note that I'm base64-encoding these to use as Firebase keys since these contain disallowed characters (but this is done at the db level of abstraction)
    * readability?
      * probably won't be staring at these directly too much, but I find the simpler format far easier to read
    * complexity?
      * every layer of abstraction hides another potential bug, and honestly relying on a "'" probably isn't super resilient to fat fingers
    * extensibility?
      * I was considering grouping my equations into different buckets anyway, e.g. equations with no variable, 1 variable, 2 variable, etc
      * if I did that, I could have different encoding schemes for keys in the various buckets (although, then we lose a bit of consistency)
    * hm, Kristian if you happen to be reading this, would love thoughts :P

TODAY:
* luu's noodle for lunch
* broke and fixed my demo
* mexican for dinner
* realized I needed a lot more conditions on my equation states q.q
* sync'd with mom on problem creation (she's up to 3 chapters now)
* started creating a chapter selection UI

LEARNINGS:
* how to use redux-responsive library to adapt UI for screen resizes
* all the public libraries close early on Friday nights :(
