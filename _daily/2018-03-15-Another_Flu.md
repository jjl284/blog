YESTERDAY:
* lunch @ Facebook
* caught another flu, so ended up sleeping it off

TODAY:
* attended a webinar by TechStars accelerator program
* pitch to FFL accelerator
* ran a test case showing that logging fails when battery is low
* created a technical decision doc
* interviewed by a startup building a new dating site
* couldn't sleep, so ended up writing a doc detailing our next key decisions around 3 am

LEARNINGS:
* surprisingly people that run accelerator programs don't always have the most polished responses to obvious questions
