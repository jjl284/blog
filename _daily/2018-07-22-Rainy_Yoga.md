YESTERDAY:
* 8:30 am yoga
  * grey day but not rainy until class finished
  * took a nice stroll back in the rain and chatted with parents on the phone
* shower, then biked back out in the rain to work
  * WeWork building was locked :(
  * customer support unavailable over weekend
  * ate a delicious fried egg, bacon, and avocado sandwich for lunch
  * got into different WeWork office down the street
* second lunch at Potbelly's sandwiches
* nap
* wrote an optimization for a validation check
* tried to go to Flowers of Vietnam (rare vietnamese restaurant in Detroit)
  * super packed
  * ended up at Slow's BBQ ... yet again :D
* dancing at a wine bar
* ping-pong

TODAY:
* Whole Foods run
  * dropped by a StarBucks
* grilling in the rain
  * delicious chorizo
* finished coding a debug feature (will test tomorrow)
* nap
* read 1.5 books of the Heartland Trilogy
  * basically YA novels with elements of Hunger Games ...
* simple TV dinner, veggies, and leftovers for dinner
* watched videos on how to create effective OKRs and KPIs
  * created a weekly update template based on learnings
* workout
  * watched a bit of Star Wars

LEARNINGS:
* in OKR land
  * the objective answers "to do what?" and is the "reason" for doing tasks, or the "mission"
    * should describe an achievement
    * specific enough to create focus but ambiguous enough to allow autonomy
  * key results are specific, measurable, and show progress towards the objective
    * should have a known starting value
    * should be happy if you get 70% of that result
