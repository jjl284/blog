YESTERDAY:
* nope, no idea what happened on this day
* git log shows that I got my firmware build onto CircleCI though :D
* this probably means I spent the better part of the morning learning docker

TODAY:
* I remember spending at least 45 minutes creating a coding problem for a promising candidate
* late night climbing at 9 am
* finished a v5!
* ended up at in-n-out before sleeping

LEARNINGS:
* need to update my blog before I forget things
* also docker!
