YESTERDAY:
* made a tasty pork loin dinner w/ friend
  * was peeling potatoes
  * accidentally peeled part of my finger :'(
  * told guitar teacher I might be unavailable for a bit
* read Timothy Zahn's Thrawn book
  * stayed up till 3 am finishing it straight through

TODAY:
* picked up some anti-stick gauze
* lunch w/ sis and friends
* gave sis a tour of the office space
* contemplated April Fool's pranks for office mates
* yoga
* made a pork and snow pea stir-fry
  * did not add any extraneous body parts

LEARNINGS:
* use anti-stick gauze
  * otherwise taking out the gauze can cause bleeding to start again :(
