YESTERDAY:
* slow recovery on the flu/asthma combo :(
* woke up, made a soup for lunch, went back to sleep
* chat with advisor prepping for virtual meeting on Thursday with GoodYear representatives
  * a manager for their startup group and a staff data engineer!
* finished hooking up problem set handling

TODAY:
* dumplings for lunch
* dropped by Medallia
* met up with Knut for climbing + dinner
* began a massive refactor on graph traversals

LEARNINGS:
* realized I need to handle i and x as invalid variable identifiers
* realized I really need to fix a rendering bug inside of MathJax
  * code actually isn't too complicated, but they must have used some sort of language that transpiles down to Javascript
  * bunch of weird boilerplate code for e.g. classes with constructors that looks pre-ES6?
* need to figure out unnecessary parentheses parsing from asciimath
