YESTERDAY:
* guitar lesson!
  * yay I can play again
* burger for lunch with a buy-one-get-one-free coupon!
  * ended up chatting with Yeager in the parking lot for an hour
* yoga was cancelled :'(
  * climbing instead
  * sadness on a v4
* groceries
* made a tasty veggie soup for dinner

TODAY:
* climbing in the morning
  * finished two 11c's clean
  * 12a was terrible though
  * think fingers are back to normal
* delicious HK cafe food for a quick lunch
  * cash only and nobody had cash xD
* meeting with hardware referral
  * super nice guy!
* cleaned up hardware spec
* wrote another piece of the autosolver puzzle
* picked up some worcestershire sauce
  * tried to make HK baked pork chop for dinner!
  * I give it a C- grade
  * had to cook the pork twice cuz it wasn't finished the first time
  * didn't make enough sauce
  * fried rice was ... just bad xD

LEARNINGS:
* how not to cook a pork chop
  * namely, don't add too much flour
* also, at least keep the proportions the same if making less sauce ...
  * way too little ketchup
