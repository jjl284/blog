  * too bad Android runs on Dalvik, no flight recorder + JMC ...
* Skype guitar lesson
* went to a climbing event to meet other peoples
  * got some free trail mix bars
* in n out
* my $15 blender finally broke after ~4 years
  * looks like gear connection to the blades is too loose
  * hard to fix since there are no reachable screws to disassemble
  * attempted a few fixes, but think I need a replacement :(

TODAY:
* fft in Python and started doing signal analysis
* burrito for lunch
* server-side refactor to Java
  * stache messaging working perfectly still :D
* oscilloscope demo
* went to Square HQ for dinner
  * parking was fun

LEARNINGS:
