YESTERDAY:
* drove up to SF in the morning
* presented a technical debt to potential investor
  * very little prep for this one
  * didn't anticipate the right questions
  * deck was super out of date
* burrito for lunch
* discovered one of my data sciency optimizations didn't work for new sensor hardware
  * ended up forking codebase to handle it
* added a limited sample extraction piece
* couldn't focus
* second yoga class in a row
  * super small class size
  * very relaxing though
* finished soup for dinner

TODAY:
* added a config customization feature to app
  * discovered a fun bug in there (had to do with ODR configurations)
* met up with Shantanu (one of my interns) for lunch!
  * he's doing fantastic as usual :D
* meet up with Sunjay for a quick sync
* nap
* benchtop testing in the afternoon
* steamed a massive tilapia for dinner
  * also stir-fried zucchini, carrots, shrimp, and egg
* got to try out some Chinese cupping thing?
  * very weird ...

LEARNINGS:
* definitely got a bit depressed after that not-so-great meeting :(
  * coding ain't the way to cope
