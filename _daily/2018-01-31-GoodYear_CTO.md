YESTERDAY:
* implemented autocompletion with suggestions for a variable type text input component in my app :P
* subway for lunch
* picked up some medicines for Amy
* massive chicken dinner from Safeway
* practicing pitch
* late night climbing

TODAY:
* pitched to a team of executives from GoodYear
  * half of them were like "wow this is cool!"
  * the other half were like "hm, they want to compete with US?"
* checked specs on the actual hardware components for our sensors
  * turns out the pressure sensor is only rated to measure up to 16 PSI ...
* sprint planning (lol)
* got down my test cases for actual driving experiments to perform starting Friday
* got sensor configuration standardized and recorded

LEARNINGS:
* how to obtain data network type info from Android
* cellular network standards and how they map to generations (3G, 4G, etc)
