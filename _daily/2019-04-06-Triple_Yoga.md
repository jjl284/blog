YESTERDAY:
* morning board call was lovely
* two sandwiches and a salad for lunch
* working with the team on our next set of experiments!
* Doris's yoga class
  * gave me a high tension black band
* 99 chicken for dinner
* fun with taxes!
* spent the night watching WLIIA reruns

TODAY:
* early morning yoga
  * lady next to me decided to surprise me with an ice cube
  * was I supposed to thank her?
  * wasted an opportunity for an "ice to meet you" joke
* guitar lesson
* leftover chicken for lunch
* spent an hour on support with TurboTax
  * she did actually successfully resolve my issue (hooray!)
* afternoon coding
* 2nd yoga class
  * was too shy to demonstrate supported headstand for the class
  * but I did manage to do it!!
* target run, picked up a cheap athletic shirt and paper towels
* steamed a fish for dinner
* also made black bean chicken chow fun
  * holy cow, think I finally got the timing down
* downloaded Sekiro, pretty fun + frustrating

LEARNINGS:
* man my reaction time is shot after a year of no ping-pong
