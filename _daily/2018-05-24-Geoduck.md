YESTERDAY:
* laundry
* dumplings for lunch
* got my Bluetooth working
  * figured out how to get a device name to show up properly
  * figured out how to register read-only characteristics
  * will tackle writing tomorrow
* relaxing yoga class
  * firefly pose!
* very healthy geoduck soup for dinner
  * super expensive too <.< (
* Magic eraser'd my entire bathtub
  * it's so shiny now :D

TODAY:
* off to office early
* productive day, figured out BTLE writes on nRF52
  * figured out the other way to create characteristic user descriptions
  * hooked up temperature, pressure, and recording modes
* lunch @ Subway
* massive nap
* yoga
* started reading Android docs on Bluetooth stack
* saw a terrible movie, it's so bad I won't even name it cuz my sister would say i told you so ...

LEARNINGS:
* apparently you can't advertise both a device name and mfg name in Nordic's BTLE stack
* how to support re-connect after disconnecting
* apparently there are two ways to add characteristic user descriptions in Nordic
  * not entirely sure what the difference is yet, but with the explicit way:
    * you can only have one per service and it has to be at the last characteristic declared
    * plus, I never actually got it to work, ended up with invalid parameter errors
    * also, none of the examples in the SDK invoke sd_ble_gatts_descriptor_add
  * the other way is to add it as a sub-property
