YESTERDAY:
* dumplings for lunch
* short hike at Castle Rock
* watched a very dramatic romantic Indian movie (The Lunchbox)[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2350496/]
* wrote a few more specs
* fixed a bunch of unit tests for math app and refactored two autosolvers

TODAY:
* morning yoga!
  * haven't done an early exercise in a while
* tiny change on a db update to get a 13x speed improvement on a functional test that took ~3 minutes to run before :D
* lunch at Gobi mongolian bbq!
  * ... not that great actually :( maybe my tastes have changed?
* evening yoga
* ping-pong cuz I didn't get enough cardio today
  * got schooled by a guy with a shirt from University of Taiwan
* switched my regression fit function from a polynomial to a 'harmonic oscillator'
* made a delicious tomato pork stew for dinner

LEARNINGS:
* read some fascinating papers on things people try to detect with tire sensors
  * not convinced many of these are reproducible ...
  * also they all seem to be based on very few test cases (n<10)
* super out of shape on ping-pong ...
