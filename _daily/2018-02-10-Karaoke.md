YESTERDAY:
* began refactoring Android app
  * <.< people advising not to use enums in Android Java?
  * added streaming data for signal strength and battery level indicators
* seafood dinner
  * fun game of betrayal at the house on the hill

TODAY:
* guitar
* lunch with Amy and a stroll through GoodWill
* yoga
* karaoke!
* finished refactor, but found out that the API implemented remote task execution using a similar design pattern as the OLAP stuff at Medallia
  * unlike Medallia though, they didn't document any obvious restrictions (e.g. no side effects allowed in this particular piece of code nor conditional logic)

LEARNINGS:
* much easier to sing after a yoga class, think it's due to the breathing control
