  * demonstration of extraction and initial drying
* plantation visit also included a short waterfall hike and a lunch
* afternoon flight back to Yangon
* hung out at the 2nd coolest mall in Yangon
* late night coffee with Tett's friends

TODAY:
* relatively late morning rise
* breakfast at Shwe Paw Lin, great noodle spot
* head to Scott Market for souvenirs
* picked up a little purse for Amy's birthday present
* got slightly obsessed with jade elephants
  * bought three (haggled price down to $18 for the set)
* then I found a set of 7 which will work wonderfully for my cousins when I see them in May
* fought the afternoon rush hour traffic to drop off two companions at the airport
* afternoon exploration of the docks of Yangon
  * ended up getting a tour of Tett's family's business

  * delicious spiced mutton dish
  * dessert had a bit of butter

LEARNINGS:
* what true entrepreneurship looks like
  * Tett's dad built that business from scratch
  * hiring laborers to move oil from the shipping containers into barrels
  * optimizing the local reallocation from barrels to containers
  * entire accounting team is still doing things by hand, summing end-of-day totals done by uncle/mom
