YESTERDAY:
* leftover pho for lunch
* korean spicy noodles for dinner!
* caught up with Hoang over a docker debugging exercise

TODAY:
* dumplings for lunch
* Oren's for dinner!

LEARNINGS:
* Difference between useradd and adduser
  * Former is a linux command, latter is wrapper perl script
  * Former does NOT by default create home directories (or assign permission for them correctly)
