YESTERDAY:
* bunch of tire installs
* dumplings and bon chon for lunch
* found a cool bug
* leftover sausage and corn + bon chon for dinner
* bunch of refactors to get automation testing on embedded code
* Makefile woes

TODAY:
* lldb, easy find + fixed bug
* bunch more tire installs
* endless demo prep
  * really need to write some automated tests for the backend logic

LEARNINGS:
* surprisingly not sick of bon chon yet ...
