YESTERDAY:
* finally moved into our new office space! yay!
* our landlords are pretty stingy:
  * they want to charge us $10 for a key to lock our cabinets
  * also wanted to charge us $25 for a badge to use the office during night/weekends
* meeting with patent lawyer on provisional patent filing
* met with two representatives from GoodYear
  * secured CTO meeting for next week :D
* modified our webpage for next ad campaign experiment
* dinner w/ friends
  * finished Tokyo Tribes, a really weird rap musical about the Tokyo gang scene ...
* got pressure sensor working, temperature still broken
* two recordings for guitar

TODAY:
* finally felt better, so I made a smoothie for breakfast
* help friend prep for a bunch of upcoming interviews
* got temperature sensor working
* practice our pitch for ~6 hours
* made the website look somewhat demo-able
  * integrated mystache components so we can notify users about tire warnings
  * my services are still working perfectly after 3 months without touching them!
* tiny bit of rock climbing
* laundry
* making lo mai fan for potluck tomorrow!
* added redundancy so demo will work if offline

LEARNINGS:
* difference between an apparatus claim and a methodology claim (former would be e.g. a new type of sensor, latter would be e.g. how you install it optimally)
* I'm terrible at reading from a script :(
* there's a lovely blacklist in redux-persist which helps avoid writing too much data into local storage
