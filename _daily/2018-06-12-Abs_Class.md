YESTERDAY:
* got stuck on external flash late last night
* switched to figuring out internal flash today
* lunch at in n out
* got internal flash working
  * except deletes ... weird timeout error code
* went to an abs and core class
  * super energizing instructor
  * short, efficient class
* picked up banjo picks I left behind at a party
* fried eggs with honey roast pork for dinner
  * left over vegetable soup
  * finished my super bitter mysterious Asian greens
* watched a few more banjo tutorials

TODAY:
* forgot to charge phone last night
* stir-fried green beans with mushrooms for lunch
* more testing on external flash
* working on power readings
  * finally got this working after ~4 hours
* nap
* found out pressure readings are incorrect!
  * figured out that the breakout board was an 14BA whereas production board uses 05BA!!!
  * swap out some code and voila!
* went for a lovely walk and called ze parents
* little sheep for dinner
* watched the Breadwinner

LEARNINGS:
* looks like one has to call fds_stat before reads work properly at all in the nrf52 flash data storage library
* also apparently nrf_pwr_mgmt_run and __WFE are not exactly interchangeable
* test which user bitbucket thinks you are via:
  * ssh -T hg@bitbucket.org
* adc driver was only intended for nrf51 and is not supported on nrf52, we should use saadc driver instead
  * obviously since there's a handful of #defines missing in nrf52_bitfields.h that exist in nrf51_bitfields.h
  * found one forum post explaining this ...
  * on the other hand, now I know how ADC works and how to convert values back to voltage readings
* when compile fails, make clean and try again ...
  * wasted an hour trying to figure out why my header file #define wasn't being used correctly
