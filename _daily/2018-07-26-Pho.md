YESTERDAY:
* woke up with sore throat
* morning meetings with mentors from Siemens and Bosch
* salad for lunch
* afternoon meetings with more from Ford
* tacos for dinner
* unified UART upload scripts
* late night exploration of a cool food plaza built on stacked shipping containers
  * mediocre pho place, but fantastic for sore throat

TODAY:
* laundry
* packed for return trip
* fixed website
* biked to another pho place


LEARNINGS:
* watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rARpcwZThl8&mc_cid=b01cf4a5c4&mc_eid=3e0d8754d5&t=66m) basically adding structure to roadmap item selection
  * basically, take every possible risk, then rank based on impact and complexity of evidence gathering required to remove risk
