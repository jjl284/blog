YESTERDAY:
* cleaning spree
  * wiped up my microwave
  * cleaned up these little containers that sit over my stovetop
  * bash script cleanup
  * used my dishwasher again
* running low on
  * tissues
  * paper towels
  * toilet paper
* Jackie picked up groceries
* two types of dumplings and vegetable stew over macaroni for lunch
* crazy sneezing fits
  * couldn't code effectively
  * took two naps
* steamed a tilapia for dinner
* watched a few Pixar shorts

TODAY:
* Jackie made pancakes!
  * but she forgot the flour so they were basically super sweet fluffy eggs
* made a faux McDonald's dinner!
  * Jackie made a sausage egg mcmuffin using real eggs and Italian sausage
  * I made dinosaur chicken nuggets and baked fish
  * forgot the fries q.q

LEARNINGS:
* dino nuggets aren't nearly as good as they were in college
* also Jackie really doesn't like dinosaur nuggets
